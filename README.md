## RoP/Z-Finder Trading Sim

Godot application to simulate trading strategies using S&P 500 Futures market data (or any market data in json format).

This project was developed to both create a prototype of running trading strategies outside of the Quantower trading software and test our "Double Entry" trading strategy we developed years ago. Using this project as an example, one could easily import market data in json format and code various automated trading strategies and algorithms for backtesting. 

I find that backtesting outside of trading software in this way has many benefits, with the only drawback being having to manually build all indicators and visualization oneself. If you are not concerned with visualization, this is an excellent tool for backtesting data-focused strategies.

This is the first prototype of this application, and I have since made a fully-fledged backtesting software that I will not be releasing to the public until summer 2026.

# Note
The market data in this project was purchased from a data broker in its initial form. We have since reformatted and modified the data in such a way that you can legally use the data for your own projects. Feel free to make use of this data with full permissions.
